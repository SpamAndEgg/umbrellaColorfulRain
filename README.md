Arduino code for LED (WS2812) effects for an LED umbrella. 

This project code is for building an LED umbrella with WS2812 LEDs. A choseable number of LED stripes are controlled 
to display different animations, further called modes. A button allows cycling through the 6 different modes. In the 
original umbrella project, 8 LED stripes, each with 30 pixels, were were guled on each rib of the umbrella. Two 
Arduino Pro Mini were used to control the 8 stripes, while one worked unstable controlling 8 stripes. The power
supply was realized by an ordinary power bank. 

I tested this code also with an atTiny85, it works but only one LED stripe could be controlled.
